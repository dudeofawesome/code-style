# @dudeofawesome/eslint-config

You're probably looking to use this with one of our other configs:

-   [`@dudeofawesome/node`](../eslint-config-node/README.md)
-   [`@dudeofawesome/typescript`](../eslint-config-typescript/README.md)
-   ~~[`@dudeofawesome/browser`](../eslint-config-browser/README.md)~~ (This does not yet exist at time of writing)

However, if you're trying to build a new config for a new environment (maybe some new frontend framework or something), you'll want to use this config as your base.
