# @code-style/eslint-config

A set of ESLint rules customized for code corectness.

**The easiest way to get started with this project is to use our [setup script](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@code-style/create-configs).**

You're probably looking to use this with one of our other configs:

-   [`@code-style/node`](../eslint-config-node/README.md)
-   [`@code-style/cli`](../eslint-config-cli/README.md)
-   [`@code-style/typescript`](../eslint-config-typescript/README.md)
-   [`@code-style/jest`](../eslint-config-jest/README.md)
-   [`@code-style/browser`](../eslint-config-browser/README.md)
-   [`@code-style/react`](../eslint-config-react/README.md)

However, if you're trying to build a new config for a new environment (maybe some new frontend framework or something), you'll want to use this config as a layer in your project.

TODO(1): Evaluate the following plugins:
